# wfncreator

This is a GUI version of a script batch creating wfn+population Gaussian input file from last point of logfiles (using a small proxy script generating xyz matrix). It was created for Schiff bases project, but can be used with almost any Gaussian logfile (but I still recommend using GaussianMaster package).
